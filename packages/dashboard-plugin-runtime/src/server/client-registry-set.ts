/**
 * The single "client-registry plugin set" selector.
 *
 * Defines which discovered plugins take part in the plugin-registry hash.
 * Every producer selects through this module — the vite-plugin build path,
 * its dev regeneration, `scripts/generate-plugin-registry.mjs`, the server's
 * `/api/health.bundleHash`, and the build-declaration SDK — so build-time and
 * runtime hashes are computed over structurally identical sets.
 *
 * Before this module the two sides applied different filters: the build
 * dropped client-less plugins (`Boolean(p.clientEntryPath)`) while the runtime
 * kept them, so `PluginStalenessBanner` could never converge (`mcp-server` is
 * the plugin with no `client` field). Missing any one producer reintroduces
 * the split this module exists to close.
 *
 * See change: add-served-build-coherence-and-hash-parity (design D0).
